   - Uses WhatsApp icon for better recognition

2. **Secondary Direct Payment Link** (smaller, subtle)
   - Label: "أو ادفع مباشرة الآن" (Arabic) / "veya Şimdi Doğrudan Öde" (Turkish) / "or Pay Directly Now" (English)

2. Navigate to "Contact Information" tab
3. Edit the phone number entry with `type: "phone"` and `isPrimary: true`
4. Update the value field with your WhatsApp number (format: `905xxxxxxxxx`)

### Current Configuration
